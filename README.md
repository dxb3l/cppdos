# DDoS Attack Script (C++ Version)

## Description

This C++ version of the DDoS attack script is a translation of the original Perl script created by SamY from cqHack. The script is designed to perform a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack by sending a large number of UDP packets to a specified IP address and port.

## Author

This version of the script was translated to C++ by [dxb1l](https://github.com/dxb3l). The original Perl script and its credits go to [SamY](https://github.com/cqHack/DDoS-Script) from cqHack.

## Usage

To use the script, compile it using a C++ compiler and run the executable with the target IP address as a command-line argument:

```bash
./ddos_attack <target_ip>
